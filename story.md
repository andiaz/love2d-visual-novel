# Sprint Zero — Story Bible

## Premise

You are **Alex**, a UX Designer joining a new product team at a mid-sized tech company. The team has been assembled to build **Project Chimera** — a "knowledge-sharing platform" that the Product Owner describes as "Confluence meets TikTok meets LinkedIn." Nobody is sure what that means, including the Product Owner.

Over the course of 2-3 sprints (10-15 in-game days), you navigate conflicting priorities, impossible deadlines, scope creep, and office politics — trying to ship something users actually want without losing your mind.

Your choices shape relationships with teammates, the direction of the product, and ultimately whether the project succeeds, pivots, or burns everyone out.

## Characters

### Alex (UX Designer) — The Player
- The protagonist. Advocates for users in a room full of competing agendas.
- Caught between "what users need" and "what everyone else wants."
- Inner monologue provides comic relief — sarcastic observations in parentheses.

### Jordan (Project Manager)
- Obsessed with timelines, Jira boards, and "syncs."
- Means well but creates chaos by trying to keep everyone happy.
- Catchphrases: "Quick sync," "Let's take that offline," "I'll add it to the board."
- Running gag: every "15-minute standup" exceeds 30 minutes.

### Sam (Developer)
- Pragmatic, slightly cynical. Has seen projects like this before.
- Respects good UX but pushes back on complex interactions.
- Catchphrases: "Works on my machine," "That's a refactor," "Define 'simple.'"
- Potential ally if you respect their technical constraints.

### Priya (Product Owner)
- Big ideas, boundless enthusiasm, zero scope discipline.
- Changes requirements like others change socks. "I had a thought over the weekend..."
- The 47-slide deck with stock photos of people high-fiving is her masterpiece.
- Not malicious — genuinely believes every feature is essential.
- Catchphrases: "What if we also...", "Think of it as a phase 1.5!", "The vision IS the requirement."

### Riley (QA Engineer)
- Finds every edge case nobody thought of. Chronically underappreciated.
- Dry, deadpan humor. Says the quiet part out loud.
- The only person who reads the actual requirements (when they exist).
- Catchphrases: "What happens if the user does [absurd thing]?", "That's not a feature, that's a bug."

### Casey (Architect)
- Thinks in systems, abstractions, and whiteboard diagrams.
- Every conversation turns into a discussion about microservices, scalability, or "the right way."
- Means well but can over-engineer a toaster.
- Catchphrases: "Before we go further...", "We need to future-proof this," "Let me draw something."

## Story Arc

### Act 1: Kickoff (Days 1-3)

**Day 1 — First Impressions**
Team kickoff meeting. Everyone introduces themselves. Priya unveils the 47-slide vision deck. Alex learns the project is web AND mobile, MVP in 6 weeks. First choice: how to approach the initial design work (research vs. diving in vs. questioning scope).

**Day 2 — First Standup**
The first "15-minute" standup runs 38 minutes. Sam has only set up a git repo. Casey is already talking about microservices. Riley can't write a test plan without requirements. Priya thinks the deck IS the requirements. Alex chooses their design approach (user interviews / wireframing / demanding specs).

**Day 3 — The Demo Bomb**
Follow-up from Day 2 choices. Then: leadership wants a demo in two weeks. The team has a git repo and opinions. Alex must decide how to handle the demo pressure — build a prototype alone, collaborate with Sam, or push back.

### Act 2: Design Phase (Days 4-6)

**Day 4 — The Design Review**
Alex presents initial designs. Everyone has opinions. Casey thinks the data model is wrong. Priya wants to add three more features. Sam asks if anyone considered mobile. Riley asks what happens when the user has no internet. Key choice: whose feedback to prioritize.

**Day 5 — The Scope Creep**
Priya had "a thought over the weekend." New feature request that would double the work. Jordan tries to mediate. Casey sees an opportunity for a microservices architecture. Alex must decide whether to absorb the scope, push back, or propose a compromise.

**Day 6 — The User Research (or Lack Thereof)**
If Alex pushed for research: results reveal the product concept is flawed. If not: Alex realizes they're designing blind. Either way, a conflict emerges between what users need and what Priya wants. Key choice: follow the data or follow the vision.

### Act 3: Build (Days 7-9)

**Day 7 — Dev Handoff**
Sam starts building from the designs. Immediately finds issues. "This interaction you designed — do you know how many API calls that is?" Alex must negotiate between ideal UX and technical reality.

**Day 8 — QA Strikes**
Riley finds bugs in the prototype. Edge cases nobody considered. The notification system doesn't work on mobile. A key feature breaks when the user's name contains special characters. The team scrambles.

**Day 9 — The Pivot**
Priya changes a core feature mid-sprint after a conversation with the CEO's nephew. Jordan calls an emergency meeting. The Jira board is a wasteland. Alex faces the biggest choice yet: support the pivot, resist it, or try to find middle ground.

### Act 4: Crunch (Days 10-12)

**Day 10 — The Long Night**
Demo is approaching. The team is behind. Depending on previous choices, the team is either pulling together or falling apart. Key moments: Sam stays late to help, or Sam checks out. Casey's architecture either saves time or costs it.

**Day 11 — The Breaking Point**
Someone on the team reaches their limit. Who it is depends on accumulated relationship scores. Alex must decide how to handle the interpersonal crisis while the deadline looms.

**Day 12 — Demo Eve**
Final preparations. Last-minute decisions. The product is either a coherent prototype, a Frankenstein's monster of features, or a polished subset of the original vision. Alex's choices throughout the game determine which.

### Act 5: Launch (Days 13-15)

**Day 13 — The Demo**
The big presentation to leadership. How it goes depends on everything — the product quality, team dynamics, and how Alex handles the room. Multiple outcomes possible.

**Day 14 — The Aftermath**
The team regroups after the demo. Depending on the outcome, conversations range from celebratory to post-mortem. Relationships are tested or strengthened.

**Day 15 — The End**
Final day. Alex reflects. The ending depends on accumulated flags and relationship scores. One of four endings plays out.

## Endings

### "The Burnout"
**Trigger:** High compliance flags (always said yes, never pushed back). Low total relationship scores.

Alex did everything everyone asked. The product shipped — a bloated, incoherent mess that technically meets every requirement. Alex stares at the Jira board, now fully green, and feels nothing. They update their LinkedIn status to "Open to Work."

*"I delivered exactly what was asked for. That was the problem."*

### "The Ship"
**Trigger:** Balanced flags (mix of pushback and compromise). Medium-high relationship scores.

The team shipped a solid MVP. Not everything Priya wanted, not as architecturally pure as Casey dreamed, not as polished as Alex hoped. But it works, users like it, and the team respects each other. Jordan's standup the next morning is only 12 minutes.

*"It's not perfect. But it's ours."*

### "The Pivot"
**Trigger:** Priya's relationship score is highest. Multiple scope change flags set.

The product changed direction so many times it's unrecognizable from the original vision. It started as a knowledge platform, became a marketplace, pivoted to a social network, and launched as... a to-do list app. Priya calls it "exactly what I always envisioned." Nobody corrects her.

*"We set out to build Confluence meets TikTok meets LinkedIn. We built a to-do list. Priya is thrilled."*

### "The Promotion"
**Trigger:** High research flags. High relationship scores across the board. Pushed back on scope at key moments while maintaining goodwill.

Alex navigated politics, advocated for users, and earned the team's trust. The product isn't what anyone originally imagined — it's better, because it's based on what users actually need. Leadership is impressed. Alex gets promoted to Lead Designer. Sam sends a Slack message: "You're the first designer I've actually enjoyed working with."

*"Turns out the secret wasn't having all the answers. It was asking the right questions."*

## Running Gags & Comedy Beats

- **The 15-minute standup** — Jordan promises it every time. It never is.
- **"Can we just..."** — Famous last words before a week of work.
- **The Jira board** — Referenced but never actually updated by anyone.
- **"Works on my machine"** — Sam's default response to bug reports.
- **The 47 slides** — Priya's deck gets referenced throughout. Nobody has read past slide 12.
- **Casey's whiteboard** — Every conversation eventually involves Casey drawing boxes and arrows that explain nothing.
- **"I had a thought over the weekend..."** — Priya's harbinger of scope creep. The team learns to dread Mondays.
- **"No blockers"** — Said during standup while everything is on fire.
- **The deprioritized research** — User research keeps getting pushed to "next sprint."
- **Riley's edge cases** — Always finds the one scenario that breaks everything. "What if the user's name is null?"

### Relationship Scores
Tracked per character: `dev`, `pm`, `po`, `qa`, `arch`. Each choice adjusts these by +1/-1 or +2/-2 (occasionally +3). Final ending is determined by the combination of flags and total/individual relationship scores.

### Ending Calculation (implemented in engine/state.lua)
1. **The Promotion**: research flags >= 3 AND total relationship >= 15 AND pushback > compliance
2. **The Pivot**: PO has highest relationship score AND scope change flags >= 2
3. **The Burnout**: compliance > pushback AND total relationship < 10
4. **The Ship**: default (balanced play)

Compliance flags: `eager_for_vision`, `started_wireframes`, `made_prototype`, `prioritized_product`, `absorbed_scope`, `followed_vision`, `kept_complex_ux`, `hid_bugs`, `supported_pivot`, `pulled_allnighter`, `showed_everything`

Pushback flags: `wants_research`, `pushed_interviews`, `pushed_back_demo`, `prioritized_users`, `fought_scope`, `followed_data`, `took_ownership`, `resisted_pivot`, `set_boundaries`, `backed_riley`, `polished_subset`, `honest_demo`

Research flags: `wants_research`, `pushed_interviews`, `followed_data`, `prioritized_users`, `retro_research`
